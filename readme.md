# Genetic Algorithm Solution For Travelling Salesman Problem
This project is supported by USC CSCI561 teaching team.

## Background
TSP is defined as given a list of cities/locations, the person has to go to all the locations exactly once, return back to the starting point, and cover the minimum distance as a whole.

A location is represented as a combination of 3D coordinate points, x, y, and z. For example: (10, 0, 30) represents a city with x= 10, y = 0, z= 30. 


## Steps
1. Initial Population
2. Parent Selection: Roulette wheel based
3. Crossover: HGA Based
